Recommendation for dry skin - I'd highly recommend the Clinque Moisture Surge as a moisturizer followed by the Two Face Hangover Primer. This combo works great for my skin and lets the foundation do it's job properly. "

This honestly is heaven sent to people who have skin like me and want a foundation that can be a light cover or full cover."

I lucked out with Angel Food because it matches me quite well. I'm around NW10 in MAC terms, R210 in MUFE Ultra HD, Fair Beige in Tarte AC, and I can wear Swan in TF BtW (but it's more yellow than I prefer)."
